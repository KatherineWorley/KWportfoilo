			<p>A Chicago native, or more accurately from the home of Ovaltine USA and Portillo's Restaurants: Villa Park, Ill. Farther, my family were Slovakian immigrants who arrived at Ellis Island determined to succeed in this new land of opportunity.</p>

			<p>In my first job as a professional designer for a large pharmaceutical company, I learned that design is the cornerstone of good communication. Although my responsibilities were limited to in-house graphic design and creating direct mail materials, this experience was great training and an important step towards design, budgeting, and management.</p>

			<p>In my next position, I learned the fundamentals of press production and different types of forward printing. This is an industry that’s reinvented itself in astonishing leaps and bounds, becoming “greener” and more cost-effective within a few short years.</p>

			<p>Moving to the financial sector, first within an accounting firm and on to work for a national financial institution, I managed creative projects and programs in a variety of media. My deviation towards UI/UX design and automation within a digital, reporting and financial function have become my focus. Striving to frame financial data in an orderly, simple and effective manner to drive stronger decision-making.</p>			

			<p>As industries develop and grow in new directions, I’ll continue learning new ways to design my view of the world and myself.</p>
